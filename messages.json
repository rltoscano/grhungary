    "en_US": "<p>Welcome to our wedding website! We are delighted to be able to share the celebration of our marriage with you. For all of you who will be attending, all of the information you could ever want to know about us and our wedding will be available for you here. For those of you who will not be able to join us, we thought this would be a great way for us to share all of our experiences with you. In the following pages, you will find details about how we met, as well as information about the wedding and the reception.<p>After three wonderful years of having been married in a small ceremony at the San Francisco City Hall on March 1st, 2010, we are looking forward to our dream wedding with our families and friends in Ráckeve, Hungary. We have chosen to get married in the Savoyai Mansion Hotel, a beautiful landmark just six miles away from Gyöngyi’s hometown. It's absolutely beautiful there and we know you will love it.<p>Our goal is to create an experience that allows you to discover each others’ cultures through excellent food, drinks, and fun times. We think that the celebration of our union provides the perfect opportunity for our families and friends to meet and get to know one another. We cannot wait to see all of you together.<p>For those of you who will be coming in from out of town, we have provided you with many wonderful suggestions of places to stay. Hopefully some of you will decide to make a vacation out of this trip to Hungary and extend your stay to a full week or more. If you have the option, we encourage you to visit some of the nearby countries, as many of Europe’s amazing cities are only a short train or plane ride away from Budapest.<p>We are looking forward to seeing everyone in just a few months. Thank you to all of our friends and family for supporting us and loving us over the years.<p>Love,<br/>Gyöngyi and Robert"
